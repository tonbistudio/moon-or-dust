Trade is unlocked by the Smart Contracts tech (starts with 1 trade route).
Trade routes are global per tribe, not based on settlements. Routes take 2 turns to form (not instant). Internal routes: Tribe receives 20% of total Gold yield amount of the connected settlements as a bonus gold income per turn. External trade routes: Tribe receives 20% of the total Gold yield amount of the connected settlements as a bonus gold income per turn, plus +1 Gold for each luxury resource of the destination. Requires Neutral or better diplomatic stance. Pillaging: Trade route is broken when a military unit deals any amount of damage to either settlement in the trade route. Pillaging tribe will receive one turn worth of bonus gold that was receieved in this trade route.
These should all be +1 trade route capacity: - Smart Contracts tech: "+1 trade route capacity"
    - Currency tech: "+1 trade route"
    - Lending tech: "+1 trade route capacity"
    - Monkes tribe bonus: "+1 max trade route"

I think there should be a trade route panel that shows the trade situation, does not need to be rendered on the map. Settlements cannot receive multiple incoming trade routes from the same Tribe. Possible trade routes are limited to settlements the player can actually see. No other bonus/penalty
